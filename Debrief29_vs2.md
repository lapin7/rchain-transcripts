Raw transcript follows. Needs proofreading.

1:19 Christian I think Ed's going to join us
1:22 as well so I'll wait before we get
1:30 started
1:50 all right I don't know if he's okay well
1:57 let's just go ahead and get started and
2:00 and we have a lot a lot to talk about
2:02 but hopefully ed will join because we
2:05 also had some board resolutions that we
2:07 wanted to mention mm and let's go ahead
2:15 and the technical the technical updates
2:18 are quite fun Kent has made a lot of
2:22 progress with the compiler um so
2:29 about what you've been working on and we
2:31 can kind of go through that together
2:34 sure um so I guess first off we have the
2:42 we we cleaned up some of the tuple
2:45 space input some of the produce consume
2:49 functions on in the tuple space
2:52 implementation and then um and then we
2:57 went on and implemented to be um the I
3:06 guess the comparison and the arithmetic
3:09 operations
3:11 um on the compiler side and yeah that's
3:18 I think that's the sort of major updates
3:23 yeah yeah that's done that's exactly
3:26 right so so so look they're a couple of
3:30 little things that we want to mention
3:31 but this is all in preparation so at the
3:33 end of the month beginning on the 26th
3:35 Kent Joseph Alex Balkan and hopefully
3:38 Andrew Watson and I will all be working
3:41 intensively to get out a tutorial on
3:45 programming and rolling so there we're
3:49 going to get out kind of hello world
3:51 examples of wallet and a token contracts
3:59 so how you would write those and rolling
4:02 and of course for those kinds of things
4:05 you need arithmetic and you need unique
4:10 comparators you you need to be able to
4:13 say add this much to the existing
4:15 balance unless the balance is less than
4:18 zero or take this from the existing
4:22 balance less than zero so those are
4:25 those are basic kinds of things you want
4:27 to be able to say and so those the
4:30 syntax for those is is now available
4:33 inside the language and there are a few
4:36 examples that that Kent has put up I in
4:41 preparation for this
4:42 step I put up some work both in the
4:46 rolling spec but also in December
4:49 January time frame I wrote down how this
4:52 relates to our formal semantics so what
4:55 I what I showed was that you can do a
4:59 full faithful Church Church numeral
5:05 style in coatings and and I covered not
5:09 just sort of the arithmetic kinds of
5:11 operations but operations for for lists
5:16 and other kinds of collections so so
5:19 basically all of the the built-in data
5:21 types have a nice and friendly
5:25 interpretation just in the core language
5:28 which is why we could write down the
5:29 core language and say you know that's it
5:32 that's everything
5:32 um but of course we know that that from
5:36 the point of view of convenience of
5:37 programming it's it's not nice to do
5:40 Finance using Church numerals um so so
5:48 that that is why you have to... why the
5:53 language needs to support some higher
5:54 level expression languages and sort of
5:57 many expression languages inside the
5:58 language for those kinds of computations
6:02 and calculations now what makes this
6:04 really interesting just from a language
6:06 design perspective is that because
6:10 processes are first-class so that means
6:14 that processes can be passed around and
6:17 processes can be stored and these kinds
6:21 of things it makes it easier to then say
6:25 that values or processes so in
6:29 particular you can say things like the
6:35 number one or the string hello world
6:37 those are all those are all values and
6:41 because of the way a row line works
6:44 there they end up being processes and
6:48 and so we have a natural way to provide
6:53 the common
6:55 the the sort of common arithmetic syntax
6:59 which is a little bit harder in and
7:02 other kinds of approaches it the way I
7:07 like to think about it is because of the
7:08 reflective character
7:12 of Rholang we we have a relationship we have
7:17 sort of that the multiset ends up being
7:19 the data structure for role I like the
7:22 list is the data structure for Lisp or
7:26 scheme or those kinds of which is we
7:33 sort of have the same kind of natural
7:34 data program relationship inside Rholang
7:38 and the ease with which Kent has been
7:42 able to put that in is is both a
7:46 testament to Kent and his skills and and
7:49 a native intelligence but also to the
7:53 cleanliness of the semantics so so I
7:57 heartily encourage everyone to go and
7:59 take a look at that and along the lines
8:03 of semantics we also had a couple of
8:05 nice blog posts that Mike put up on the
8:10 n-Category cafe and Mike I was
8:12 wondering if you wanted to talk a little
8:13 bit about those since that relates to
8:16 the typing system for a length. sure so
8:19 we wrote up those two papers and put
8:21 them on the archive and that garnered
8:24 some interest from John Baez at the end
8:27 category for cafe so I wrote up one post
8:30 that introduced the concept of a graph
8:35 and with career theory for programmers
8:39 of the veer theory is very similar to an
8:43 interface for a class that is it gives
8:46 the API but not any of the
8:50 implementation details together with
8:53 axioms that any implementation has to
8:56 satisfy so then an implementation of
8:59 that would consist of code for the the
9:03 methods and so on
9:05 together with proofs that the code
9:07 satisfied those axioms in most
9:12 programming languages people will
9:16 try to substitute tests for proofs but
9:18 you know this is a very mathematical
9:20 thing so we stick with with proofs so
9:24 graph enriched Lawvere theory captures
9:29 captures the basic data that goes into
9:33 describing a term calculus so the first
9:37 thing that you need in order to describe
9:39 how a computer computes is what the
9:41 state of the computer looks like if
9:45 you're doing a simple computation model
9:49 like lambda calculus the entire state of
9:51 the computer is just the lambda term if
9:54 you're doing computation on a Turing
9:58 machine however you have the state of
10:00 the tape you have the transition table
10:07 that shows how writing a cell here I'm
10:10 sorry if you're it if you're pointing it
10:12 at this cell here then if it's a zero
10:15 you move to the left that was already
10:17 change it to a one and move to the right
10:18 or if it's one then you you know do
10:24 whatever right that the transition table
10:26 of the Turing machine also the current
10:33 state of the Turing machine and the
10:38 position of the read/write head on the
10:41 tape so all of that stuff has to go into
10:43 the description of the current state of
10:45 the Turing machine. Real programming languages
10:48 have immensely more complicated states
10:52 in JavaScript you've got two different
10:55 stacks a heap and a whole bunch of other
11:00 stuff that that goes in there into
11:04 describing the state so for each
11:06 different piece of this state you'll
11:08 have what's called a sort that
11:12 represents that piece the next chunk of
11:17 data you need is how to build up each
11:21 chunk so in lambda calculus you'll start
11:25 with variables so you'll have one sort
11:28 for variables
11:29 and then you build up terms by
11:31 application and abstraction so there are
11:34 these term constructors that you
11:36 describe next there are equations on the
11:43 term constructors so that tells what
11:47 kind of structure that is written down
11:50 in the syntax we want to ignore for
11:53 example if we're writing a function f of
11:57 X equals x squared that's really the
11:59 same function as f of y equals y squared
12:01 we don't care which variable is used
12:04 it's a dummy variable
12:05 similarly in rho calculus we don't care
12:08 about the order in which processes are
12:13 written down in the term because they're
12:16 all running in parallel there there's no
12:19 implicit order on these processes so
12:22 writing down equations that Express what
12:28 kind of structure we want to ignore is
12:30 the third piece the fourth piece is the
12:35 reduction rules the lambda calculus
12:38 that's beta reduction in rho calculus
12:41 that's the synchronization and
12:44 communication rule
12:48 and in and finally there is a machine
12:55 that's the transition yes that's the
12:57 transition function for a virtual
12:59 machine and finally there's the set of
13:03 contexts in which reductions can happen
13:06 in most modern functional programming
13:09 languages even if you have T reducing to
13:13 T Prime some term some state of the
13:15 computer T reducing to T Prime
13:18 you don't want lambda X T to reduce to
13:23 lambda X T Prime in Haskell literature
13:26 that's called week head normal form that
13:28 you don't reduce anything underneath a
13:32 lambda so all of that data is captured
13:38 in this notion of a graph enriched
13:41 lawvere theory so that was what the first
13:44 post is about the second post was about
13:46 how we can use reflection which is the R
13:51 in row calculus to make reasoning about
13:56 the operational semantics easier it
13:59 turns out that reasoning about languages
14:01 with binders in it is hard in 2005 there
14:05 is a set of challenge problems on
14:10 representing binders called the  POPLmark 
14:13 challenge but the original approach
14:17 to reasoning about languages with
14:19 binders was to eliminate them using some
14:23 kind of
14:25 homomorphism of calculate so in the case
14:29 of lambda calculus to get rid of the
14:32 lambda binder you translate it into
14:38 excuse me into SKI calculus where
14:40 they're just these three combinators and
14:43 you can express every lambda term in
14:47 terms of those and so that result had
14:55 been known since the thirties that you
14:58 could do this abstraction elimination
15:01 when Milner proposed the pi calculus in
15:04 1990 people started trying to do
15:07 something similar Yoshida in 1995 was
15:10 able to get rid of binders coming from
15:13 an input prefix so the before
15:16 construction in rolling but she wasn't
15:21 able to get rid of the new names sorry
15:25 that the bound names coming from the new
15:27 operator Greg and Matthias Radestock
15:33 matthias or matthias anyway
15:39 mattias MTS thank you Matthias Radestock
15:43 showed how to use quoting and
15:48 dereference operators to eliminate the
15:53 use of new in the PI calculus and in
15:56 their paper that described the rho 
15:59 calculus from which rolling is derived
16:02 and so then in our papers we used that
16:08 technique in two different ways on pi
16:13 calculus 1 using the Yoshida style
16:16 abstraction and another one using s ki
16:19 style abstraction elimination
16:24 and so I described the resulting
16:26 theories there so that's a summary of
16:31 the lead-up work we're doing the the
16:35 resulting graph and rich love your
16:37 theories capture the operational
16:38 semantics and then you can use those to
16:42 in applicative calculate like lambda
16:46 calculus and SK I you can throw away
16:49 some information and recover the
16:53 denotational semantics that is that
16:58 individual terms can be modeled by
17:01 functions in concurrent calculate like
17:04 row calculus and pi calculus it the
17:08 evolution is of course non-deterministic
17:10 so you can't model them directly by
17:13 functions and this gives us a roadmap
17:18 for how to how to approach the
17:22 denotational semantics of these
17:24 concurrent calculate I can ask really
17:28 quick Mike
17:29 okay what's specific about the quoting
17:33 and dereference operators that makes
17:35 that possible it's the fact that new can
17:44 be thought of as splitting up into two
17:46 parts one of them is very much like an
17:52 input in that it's declaring a new scope
17:55 under which a name is bound and the
17:58 other part is providing a fresh name so
18:01 new can be represented as input a fresh
18:06 name from some process that produces
18:08 them and then evaluate the this term in
18:12 that context and that's precisely what
18:16 what Greg's transformation does is come
18:22 up and it's parametric in two processes
18:26 one of which defines a name space and
18:30 the other one produces a fresh name in
18:33 that name space
18:37 so as you recurse downward through the
18:42 structure of the term it's defining a
18:45 namespace for each substructure of the
18:47 term and then defining a new fresh name
18:51 in that namespace so that it's
18:53 guaranteed to be fresh in netskope
18:57 actually first of all I want to say that
19:00 was a remarkably succinctly clear
19:02 description thanks like that was this
19:04 really you did it better than I did um
19:10 but I just wanted to panel ambient
19:13 calculus does that lot have input
19:15 prefixes there's there's an extension to
19:18 the ambient calculus that does but the
19:21 the pure and being calculus without that
19:26 doesn't have prefixes and so that makes
19:28 it very hard to use reflection to do
19:32 this trick Greg had to come up with an
19:35 entirely different approach to ambient
19:39 to get a representation of them in rho
19:43 calculus using namespaces for the
19:45 ambience rather than just the standard
19:48 reflection that he used to get rho
19:51 calculus from pi yeah and actually is
19:56 quite interesting there
20:01 will distract encoding of the ambient
20:02 calculus into PI so showing that the ambient
20:06 calculus is considerably more expressive
20:10 than pi calculus the ambient calculus is
20:14 like at the other end of the spectrum
20:16 it's too expressive one one thing that
20:22 is what one thing that is is worth
20:25 mentioning also just as a quick
20:27 extension to to Mike's comments when
20:31 Matias and I were doing this work Matias
20:34 was sort of exploring an obvious
20:37 solution which is that you like what one
20:41 suite once we knew we had this trick
20:43 then then there there essentially to
20:45 this bifurcation in the approaches one
20:48 is you have a fresh name server so this
20:52 is kind of a runtime approach when you
20:54 need a fresh name
20:57 the fresh name server will
20:59 pony up a fresh name for you and even in
21:03 2002 when I was carrying out this work I
21:07 didn't like that approach because it's
21:11 centralized and I was already aiming for
21:15 a decentralized solutions so the
21:18 solution that I came up with in the
21:26 um paper is a compile-time solution with
21:30 which is decentralized so there is no
21:35  ponying up these fresh names it
21:38 happens as a result of a compilation of
21:41 the of the PI term so
21:45 erm you compile it into a rho calculus
21:47 term and as a part of the process of the
21:49 wrote of the rho calculus the
21:51 compilation two rho calculus you you get
21:55 this decentralized fresh name idea and
21:58 that that turns out to be quite powerful
22:01 and it's almost like the future was was
22:07 reaching back into my mind and second
22:10 saying you know you're gonna need this
22:12 decentralized stuff soon so so that's
22:17 that that is one of the one one of the
22:21 subtleties there there's a there's
22:22 another subtlety which is super super
22:24 mathematical so I will go into it but
22:26 but for those out there who are
22:28 interested there's a connection between
22:29 fresh names and Galois extensions so
22:32 there's a third there's a third solution
22:34 and the other way to think about is that
22:36 it's related to being able to have
22:40 recursively defined names so the grammar
22:44 for the rho calculus does not allow for
22:46 there to be infinitary names all the
22:50 names have the finite information in
22:52 them but if you but you can provide
22:57 recursive limit points and and then
23:01 there's a there's a perfectly consistent
23:02 calculus that's representable in a
23:04 computer that has recurred
23:11 and that gives you yet a third approach
23:13 to to eliminating new I haven't written
23:17 up that approach so if there's any
23:19 intern summer interns out there who want
23:23 to who want to work on that that
23:25 particular extension where we're always
23:27 we're always up for folks who are
23:29 interested in that kind of stuff
23:30 engaging with folks that way um thank
23:32 you Mike that was fantastic
23:34 um so is it on I don't know yeah I'm
23:39 here
23:39 alright well let's let's move on to -
23:45 from the technical stuff - a little bit
23:47 of the business stuff and then come back
23:48 to some other technical updates oh yeah
23:50 I got a few things to update on the
23:54 first thing is a actually a question for
23:58 Kent or Greg on the the math in in
24:03 rolling uh it was I'll tell a little
24:06 story is like so Lisa our CFO was
24:10 working on balancing out you know some
24:14 of the historic amp and Bitcoin
24:16 transactions for coop and noticed that
24:21 Excel didn't add up correctly when it
24:24 went down to eight digits of precision
24:27 and actually what happened is Excel and
24:31 Google sheet used floating point math
24:33 which only handles fifteen significant
24:36 digits so it was of course that you know
24:42 for CFO types that like to balance to
24:45 the penny this was driving her nuts and
24:47 I've been so you know for me I ever
24:50 realized the problem I thought it would
24:52 just round it you know she's like no I
24:53 can't do that
24:55 so my question
24:59 but while IBM was involved in the ECMO
25:03 script standardization yeah committee
25:06 for es4 and the only thing they wanted
25:09 the one and only feature and all of
25:13 their support was focused on give us
25:15 decimal number types yeah so yeah I
25:18 think you know either fixed point
25:20 precision or anyway we just we have to
25:22 make sure
25:23 we handle many significant digits I'm
25:29 some bloody fun so we're doing this in
25:34 stages we're just just just too quick
25:41 your audios cutting over can you hear me
25:43 your audios been cutting out all call no
25:46 one else's has well that's weird
25:49 I wonder what's going on it's been
25:51 having actually let me see what's going
25:56 on let me try sir Greg it's like this
26:00 every time in when we're in one of these
26:02 zoom meetings
26:03 so it's unlikely that you'll be able to
26:05 fix it right yeah it's a it happens in
26:07 Skype occasionally do I believe any with
26:11 your machine Greg the simple solution
26:13 table yeah I'm not sure actually kit can
26:16 you am i cutting out now can you hear me
26:18 okay now it's something out you know
26:22 very frequently a Greg mean every time
26:24 you talk euro is use on for two seconds
26:27 and then it goes out for two seconds
26:29 okay well is it better now can you hear
26:32 me now at the most okay cool so what I
26:35 just did was I switched from my to the
26:39 five on the network provided by Comcast
26:43 so I think it may be a network issue
26:45 with the to the my this machine is just
26:48 far enough away from the modem that I I
26:50 usually have it on the - rather than the
26:52 five ah so so but I just switched to the
26:55 five and that seems to be better
26:57 um can you is it is has it stayed goes
27:00 to the bar all right Austin so it seems
27:02 like it was a networking issue um so I
27:07 just wanted to mention briefly what
27:09 we're doing obviously we're doing the
27:11 language in stages right we're you know
27:13 we start with a core that we will well
27:15 understand then we then we make
27:17 extensions so the extensions for the
27:21 numeric types right now are just the
27:23 numeric types that are easily supported
27:25 in Java and so so we're going to be
27:30 stuck with those limitations however one
27:33 of the little pieces of brain candy that
27:36 I put in the in the the church numeral
27:42 paper for rolling is that we can not
27:47 only do infinite precision we can do we
27:50 can do one better
27:52 we have we have um there's there's a
27:56 clean and coding of Conway's surreal
27:59 numbers into rolling no I'm not claiming
28:03 that that would be computationally
28:04 efficient but we can be infinitesimally
28:09 precise Oh
28:12 so anyway back back to you that's
28:16 awesome that's good to hear um so I'm
28:19 gonna jump around on different topics uh
28:21 as as Greg reviewed last week we worked 
28:26 on a document around the supply of the
28:30 staking tokens and I'll face the link
28:34 here ins is Spock if I find the right
28:36 place where is it hiding there is or in
28:40 zoom rather so that that's the document
28:43  and one of the reasons that's important
28:46 is for new investors that we're talking
28:49 to want to really understand you know
28:53 that either either the amount of rock
28:58 they may get or certainly the amount of
29:00 rocks that are chain holdings holds and
29:04 what its future utility is relative or
29:08  they know the conversion to Reb what
29:09 that future utility is relative to other
29:12 staking tokens that might be produced
29:15 and we talked about that last week and
29:16 so feel but anyway so we're going to
29:18 have a board resolution from the
29:20 cooperative so that they have you know
29:23 as much comfort as as we can provide in
29:26 that in their decision um let's see so
29:31 yeah a number of investors have been
29:33 approaching a Greg and me a so often
29:37 separately sometimes together and we're
29:39 actively following up with those
29:41 conversations um we are continuing to
29:46 have fundraiser pitches and feedback we
29:48 have another session this afternoon and
29:51 those are going quite well as you all
29:54   know it takes a while to explain um
29:56 depending on you know who the investor
29:59 is and what their comfort level is with
30:01 crypto and so forth so that we have to
30:04 be a little bit flew
30:05 in how we present you know based on
30:08 their background but also just where the
30:10 conversation goes because the surface
30:14 area to cover is so large we had a Glade
30:19  a good financial planning session Lisa
30:22 Greg and navneet and myself earlier this
30:24 week on Monday I think that was where we
30:29 talked about the the staffing forecast
30:32 of the coop growing the team to about 20
30:38 for the development and then a few more
30:41 those would be as as many contractors as
30:45 possible versus employees is kind of the
30:49 the mix and that would allow if I
30:51  remember Greg about four or five on each
30:55 of the teams for storage for comms for
30:59 the virtual machine layer and for system
31:03 contracts I may not have that quite
31:05 perfect but that's roughly the shape of
31:06 it yeah that's from that's roughly the
31:09 shape of it and then things will morph
31:11 over time right like like the comms and
31:13  storage are fairly well contained
31:16 efforts and so you know once those are
31:20 nailed down they're nailed down and so
31:22 people if people want to be moving
31:24  upward to working on system level
31:26 contracts or they want to try their hand
31:27 at some of the finer details of language
31:29 design or compiler worker or they want
31:32 to get into the consensus stuff the
31:34 Casper stuff you know um you know there
31:36 is more than enough work and and and
31:41 it's it's rich interesting and and good
31:44 technical work so let's go ahead and
31:46 then put that out there so right now
31:49 Nash and Kelly and Mike are with their
31:53 with power of X and their power of X is
31:55 handling our staffing so if there are
31:59 developers out there we kind of have to
32:02 hit the ground running as soon as the
32:05 the major bulk of the first tranche hits
32:07 the bank accounts we need to be rolling
32:10 so we need to we need developers you
32:13 know in interviewing best right right
32:16 away so if you're out there you're just
32:18 encrypt occur
32:19 see you're interested in language design
32:20 you're interested in consensus these are
32:23 all tough interesting fascinating
32:25 problems and a either desire and
32:29 aptitude to learn formal method just and
32:31 functional programming is part of that
32:33 whole mix yeah concurrency theory
32:35 absolutely yeah awesome um so can
32:42 continue please
32:44 all right cool uh so obviously on the
32:47 financial planning side that there's you
32:49 know more to do um the the
32:52 considerations around tax are really
32:54 interesting uh housing planning like
32:58 interesting interesting and maddening at
33:01 the same time know how the how the you
33:06 know that the assets are deployed in the
33:09 various crypto currencies and US dollars
33:12 so that's a that's an interesting topic
33:14 as well um so that's moving ahead uh and
33:18 then I wanted to mention also I've
33:21 mentioned this every week but we're
33:22 continuing our exploration on identity
33:25 related things so Glenn and I Quinn's on
33:28 the call here of participated in the
33:32 co-op's of bring your own identity
33:34 session that Jim White's Garber's has
33:36 been leading a slab of Saturday morning
33:38 and at least I think Glenn will be
33:41 continuing to attend those I'll tend
33:42 occasionally so that those are great
33:44 conversations um you know on the holding
33:47 side where we're looking at this
33:48 intersection of you know identity of
33:52 wallets and browser kind of interactions
33:55 and so for example I looked at you port
33:59 this week and kind of understood how how
34:02 that was working um other things that
34:04 happened within well I guess it was
34:06 maybe two weeks ago already
34:08 you know the brave browser you know
34:10 raised thirty five million in ICO in ten
34:12 minutes
34:13 um Civic just two days ago or maybe it
34:16 was yesterday thirty three million
34:18 dollars most of it was sold even before
34:20 the ICO happened um so is essentially
34:23 instantly committed you know so these
34:27 are all kinds of similar place where a
34:29 brave and civic are
34:31 working that the user can own and manage
34:34 their identity and growing it I assume
34:37 their strategies to grow into a more
34:39 rich self sovereign identity but also
34:42 you know for micro payments or to you
34:48 know for for those to reduce the
34:50 barriers and frictions between a Content
34:54 producer and the consumer so that
34:56 there's you know removing all the
34:59 middlemen and leeches along the way so
35:01 that those that are consuming content
35:05 can can get that pay for that content
35:10 and a benefit directly to the producer
35:14 so that's kind of common theme of these
35:16 things as well as the attention economy
35:18  features that we ultimately want to
35:20 build so I am really quick just a slight
35:26 commentary on the attention economy and
35:29 Greg a question for you when did you
35:32 first publish the paper on the attention
35:34  economy so the concept of the attention
35:36 economy actually uh you know wasn't
35:39 invented by scenario or Greg others you
35:43 know had that that term and that concept
35:46 out there not necessarily related to
35:48 crypto the nitrogen attention economy it
35:53 goes because way well back
35:56 I remember reading popular press
35:59 articles about attention economy in 2007
36:05 and 2008 some people were a lot of
36:09 people noticed that the the social media
36:12 constituted sort of first mechanization
36:16 or realization of the idea of attention
36:19 economy or some of the some of the key
36:21 characteristics of attention economy so
36:23 yeah that notion goes way back now
36:25 though the the specific details of you
36:31 know how this relates to cryptocurrency
36:33 how this relates to micro transactions
36:35 and and these kinds of things those were
36:39 obviously much later much later in the
36:42 game yeah
36:44 the well my point in asking was was more
36:47 so unlike the the peer-to-peer content
36:49 delivery and marketing side was you know
36:53 especially in the past couple years
36:54 there's been an absolute explosion of of
36:59 entities that are leveraging the
37:01 peer-to-peer marketing idea to further
37:04 their own brands and I thought it was
37:06 really really cool that now the industry
37:09 so well corresponds with what the
37:12 attention economy was essentially built
37:13 for low estate exactly once one micro
37:16 payments become more and more practical
37:18 on the blockchain with with our team
37:20 then it the world's gonna change all
37:23  right please yeah silligan going back to
37:26 my status let me finish up the status
37:28 and then we give Ana back to Greg so the
37:31 the other thing is so we have a medium
37:34 article and that's been written of
37:37 introducing our chain Shinkai Thornton
37:39 is written and he's going to get that
37:41 posted via KOIN fund site and then in
37:44 the near future which is great it's
37:46 going to get a lot of eyeballs on it and
37:49 then also Nathan are either do you want
37:52 to give an update on the animated video
37:54 yeah
37:56 the animated video is and it's it it's
37:59 almost cooked or early complete we have
38:01 the full video we're just going to edit
38:02 a bit of the animation itself and and
38:07 then also get feedback internally about
38:10 it so that we can go forward in making
38:14 other ones to address different
38:18 communities both developer and non
38:20 developer it and then investors and then
38:23 lastly about in that zone is we're also
38:27 in the middle of figuring out the
38:28 branding document and the colors that
38:31 we're going to use the token logo and
38:37 basically all things sort of branding
38:40 which we did not have going into the
38:43 video so that's the update awesome
38:45 thanks Nathan
38:46 uh back to you Greg uh thanks ed you're
38:53 welcome we need we need to I need to
38:57 have a big you know
38:58 world map behind me aren't you at 5:00
39:01 that's correct
39:04 exactly um so yeah some a few other
39:10 updates one of the part of the meeting
39:12 with Lisa was also to go over her
39:15 proposal to take on an acting CFO role
39:18 but the coop and so we've kind of shaken
39:23 hands on that um and so that'll be good
39:27 because I've got a lot going a lot of my
39:31 plate when it comes to just managing the
39:33 the business part I'd really like to
39:35 shuffle that off trying to get even just
39:39 getting the house in order so I can hand
39:41 over a big chunk of the functions to
39:44 Lisa nhj has been it's been a very very
39:48 time-consuming
39:50 just the big run up on on Bitcoin and
39:54 other cryptocurrencies has made it
39:55 really really hard to do certain
39:58 functions with respect to amps and the
40:00 omni platform so that was that's been
40:03 incredibly time-consuming so I'm
40:07 grateful to get some help on that um
40:10 let's see I also wanted to mention um
40:14 that we're now Mike and I sort of as a
40:19 culmination of some of the work that
40:21 Mike and I've been doing we're now
40:22 moving over into the prototyping stage
40:26 for the label algorithm so we've gotten
40:30 it to the point that we're satisfied
40:31 that the the mathematics hangs together
40:36 and so we're now making decisions about
40:41 the platform for the prototyping of the
40:45 the typing the typing algorithm and look
40:51 forward to seeing at those commits to
40:54 the repo in the not-too-distant future
40:57 I'm super excited about that I'm really
41:00 really excited this is uh you know I
41:06 don't know how to say this is gonna this
41:07 is gonna this is well let me put it this
41:10 way um
41:12 when we were we had a really nice
41:14 investor meeting with some of the folks
41:18 from auto capital on Friday kind of an
41:21 in-depth presentation and mostly we were
41:24 just focusing on our chain and the
41:26 crypto applications and these kinds of
41:29 things but it came to light you know so
41:31 we turned the conversation turned
41:33 towards the formal methods and we
41:40 mentioned the the ladle algorithm and
41:43 then I just you know offhandedly pointed
41:46 out that once you have a rich typing
41:49 mechanism like this it becomes a query
41:52 mechanism and their their eyes got wide
41:56 and the way the way to understand this
41:59 is think about the language I use
42:04 sometimes is the code is kind of the
42:05 dark matter of the internet what do I
42:09 mean by that well what I mean is that
42:12 it's a huge data asset right if you
42:15 think about github github has terabytes
42:19 of data maybe petabytes of data up in
42:22 there and and a big chunk of data Scone
42:26 and yet it's impossible to search that
42:29 code on the basis of what it does but
42:33 you have to you have to search that code
42:34 either because someone else knows that
42:36 code base so you search it socially or
42:39 you search it on the basis of some kind
42:42 of metadata or annotations which are
42:44 also often completely either misleading
42:47 or unsatisfying but if you couldn't
42:49 search it on the basis of what it does
42:51 um that would that would make it more
42:54 like a data asset now if you think about
42:57 a github is just the code that's public
43:00 plus some code that's private but it's
43:02 mostly you know public assets behind the
43:06 firewall there's a bunch of code in the
43:08 enterprises and that's also a data asset
43:11 that's completely unsearchable right all
43:14 of that all of that is searched on the
43:16 basis of social it's searched on you
43:18 know somebody who knows somebody who
43:19 knows somebody if you could search that
43:22 code just on the basis of what it does
43:25 um then certainly that code as a data
43:27 asset would be would be many times more
43:29 valuable the ladle algorithm gives us a
43:33 mechanism to search code on the basis of
43:36 what it does now if you if you move if
43:41 you think about the revolution that's
43:43 taking place with respect to contracts
43:48 and smart contracts this is not only
43:51 recovering the value of things from the
43:54 past which have been undervalued and
43:56 underutilized but it's also pointing us
44:00 towards the future because if our chain
44:03 succeeds or even you know if a theory
44:07 amuck see him succeed succeeds seeds
44:10 duration of contracts just like there's
44:14 been a proliferation of JavaScript
44:16 programs and Java programs and c-sharp
44:18 programs and and so on and so forth so
44:21 they're going to be a proliferation of
44:22 solidity programs and there's going to
44:25 be a proliferation of rolling programs
44:27 and now what you want to do especially
44:30 when we're talking about financial
44:32 models is you want to be able to manage
44:34 those models not just the data that they
44:36 work on but manage the models themselves
44:38 as if they were data assets and so you
44:43 want to be able to say remember that
44:44 contract that we use to to model
44:47 derivatives in this way right I can
44:50 trigger the name of it I really remember
44:52 who did it
44:52 right that's that's that's the sort of
44:54 scenario we can picture in our minds but
44:58 if you could write down a little type
45:02 base description of of that models you
45:06 sketch out roughly what it did then you
45:09 can actually ask the system to go and
45:11 search for that contract and so when we
45:13 when we describe some of these
45:15 potentials of just the ladle algorithm
45:18  alone um the investors got quite quite
45:22 interested in quite excited because they
45:24 hadn't they hadn't seen that angle that
45:26 the sort of you know yet another
45:30 dimension to to what we're doing with
45:33 with with our chain and rolling in the
45:36 ladle opera so
45:39 so that's why I'm very very excited to
45:42 be reaching this point where after after
45:45 almost a decade of research just on the
45:48 type the type part of this
45:50 we're getting to the point where we're
45:53 prototyping and that will be folded into
45:56 into the rolling a repo in the in the
46:01 upcoming months so it's very very
46:03 exciting for me personally but also I
46:05 think in terms of the the overall
46:07 offering and I really you know you
46:10 should you should allow your
46:12 imaginations to to run for a bit on this
46:15 they think about discovery protocols
46:18 based upon typing information so piecing
46:22 together piecing together contracts just
46:24 in time right that's another as another
46:27 example of the kind of thing that you
46:29 can do as a result of having the ladle
46:31 algorithm in operation I think Mike and
46:34 Nash have thought about a souped up
46:38 cloud-based linker how did you describe
46:44 it Mike well the idea was if you can
46:48 prove properties of a code base so you
46:54 know some subset of the programs on
46:57 github then when you do your query to
47:01 github you can get all of the code that
47:05 satisfies the property you're looking
47:10 what it means is that you can get three
47:14  monetization model or open source
47:17 s oftware where an open source developer
47:23 opts in to allowing his code to be
47:26 linked in response to one of these
47:27 queries and so the the linker service
47:33 gets a cut the open source author gets a
47:37 cut and the guy who links it in pays for
47:42 the privilege yeah that's that's a
47:45 beautiful beautiful model and and it's
47:47 tin abled not just by the the micro
47:50 currency capabilities at the blockchain
47:52 but it's critically enabled by the ladle
47:54 algorithm right it's only if you can
47:56 search on the basis of what the code
47:59 does that you have that this starts to
48:01 make more sense so so so that's that's
48:07 why we're super excited about that let's
48:09 see um any other updates that I can
48:13 think of I'm think I'm hey Greg I have I
48:19 have some real quick I need to bring to
48:20 your attention I needed I need to take
48:22  it off on between you and head though I
48:24 can do it in slack just side I just
48:26 needed yeah
48:28 that's pretty important it can be pretty
48:29 major maybe not so it's but it want to
48:33 take it here anyways keep going oh yeah
48:35 that's cool that's cool um yeah sure if
48:40 do you have time right after the call
48:41 yeah a little bit okay cool let's let's
48:44 do that um trying to think there's any
48:47 anything else I mean for me that's a lot
48:50 um have a few updates quick yeah go for
48:57 it oh yeah so then as you know I'm
49:04 searching for activities to do some side
49:07 work on the archer in cooperation and
49:10 there's no 5858 people registered and
49:17 forty people are actively involved on
49:20 our github our team members repository
49:23 there we collaborate together but
49:27 there's also some bad news
49:30 these people got registered for through
49:34 Google Forks and the answers of the
49:38 Google Forms are in spreadsheets and one
49:40 of those places was publicly exposed so
49:45 with some sensitive data that means more
49:48 than email addresses so I'm going to ask
49:52 Evan what to do about this because this
49:54 is a leakage of personal information
50:00 yeah I saw that yeah so so I'm glad with
50:05 brought to our attention and
50:06 we and that we're taking steps to
50:08 rectify the situation I understand that
50:12 the page has has been rigged given
50:15 different permissions so that that's a
50:17 step we can probably also figure out
50:21 exactly a sort of the level of traffic
50:25 t here and see if it was you know um you
50:30 know how far and wide that might have
50:32 spread yeah it was okay to the are chain
50:36 slacked on April 13th bringing this to
50:40 the attention of the community so it's
50:44 been publicly available at least um
50:48 April May and June I don't think that's
50:51 the case I pretty sure I checked
50:54 permission after that April comment and
50:57 and it was tightened for a while at
50:59 least yeah this through because it the
51:03 permission splint on and off so this
51:06 because of this Google Forms and well
51:10 giving access to it and it goes pretty
51:12 easy and it's a kind of failure in fact
51:15 but every old documents are now checked
51:21 and only certain people have access the
51:26 fact that it happened twice is kind of
51:27 concerning seems like we need to have
51:32 somebody involved in checking and
51:38 maintaining these things setting up
51:40 policies setting up procedures so that
51:43 that can't happen again things like that
51:46 yeah ah chief privacy officer or
51:49 something like that yeah yeah yeah it's
51:52 a good idea it's a good idea agreed
51:56 agreed
52:01 okay else H Jake
52:03 yeah the here the the co-op bylaws also
52:06 require that the the board pass a
52:09 privacy policy which we haven't done yet
52:12 I'd like to welcome Joseph to the to the
52:16 group I thought for the yesterday's very
52:18 excited
52:20 who wants to do something useful as a
52:22 lot to learn maybe in the noobs group
52:25 are only in that people wanting to run
52:30 rosette and run a scalar IDE and need a
52:37 little help and well who has somebody
52:40 step up steps up to coach that's prep
52:42 what we'll be doing tomorrow at one
52:44 o'clock New York time
52:50 Clemmie asking what we can do we can
52:53 pair up checking you know until we have
52:55 this a new person or you know people of
52:59 person I think can we do put two more
53:02 people as a verification anything we are
53:04 doing at least they can look into the
53:06 data and check the permissions
53:09 you
53:13 um permission permission sir proposing
53:18 to SJ is at least as they asked two more
53:21 people to look you know I mean we
53:24 shouldn't be any way doing that exposing
53:28 excel kind of thing but at least look
53:29 you know to the permissions by two more
53:32 people not only you and you know asked
53:34 to verify two more people so that the
53:37 permissions are correct they are not
53:38 public open and are you are you talking
53:43 about the UM Aramis no no no I mean
53:46 general document permissions where there
53:49 is a sensitive and function right and
53:55 yeah I I always make sure when I go in
54:00 and document that sensitive information
54:02 that the permissions are right I did
54:04 didn't notice the issues that he had um
54:16 I can I can give a an update on what
54:20 I've been working on these last few
54:22 minutes um cool cool all right so the
54:31 last time we spoke I think public
54:33 publicly about this the the route that
54:37 that we were pursuing was attaching
54:41 weights essentially to each of the teach
54:46 of the grammar constructs for rolling
54:50 and what we can always new and what we
54:54 definitely found out or you know and
54:57 what we definitely been seeing is that
54:59 on top of the e on top of the typical
55:05 information such as input size and such
55:07 as you know method invocation that we
55:10 cannot know statically at compile time
55:15 we're also dealing with non determinism
55:17 that's present just in the semantics
55:19 semantics of the language so the my
55:24 thinking
55:25 this past week has been kind of a step
55:27 beyond that and essentially essentially
55:31 you know the idea is that if we have a
55:34 dynamic mechanism then we can always get
55:36 the actual cost of a program if it's
55:40 dynamic if we have a static mechanism
55:43 then the best we can do is the maximum
55:47 and upper bound on the cost of
55:48 computation and you know as a small
55:52 example that's done typically there are
55:53 two types of non determinism one when
55:55 you have two output turns sending to one
55:58 input term and you don't know which one
56:00 which message is going to be received
56:02 first so in that case we will be forced
56:06 to take an upper bound on the largest
56:11 input size and the length of the process
56:14 of the continuation with that input and
56:18 then the other with the other message so
56:21 we take one out of those two paths and
56:24 then the other case of non determinism
56:25 of course when you have you know message
56:27 being said on one channel and there are
56:28 two input terms waiting to receive and
56:30 you don't know which is going to receive
56:33 and again we take max bounds on on that
56:36 term but since we can always get the
56:41 since we can always get a cost
56:42 dynamically that method should take
56:45 precedence developing developing that
56:48 method and actually it's pretty
56:51 interesting I'll explain in a moment but
56:52 we find an overlap in what our static
56:55 versus dynamic cost analysis they kind
56:58 of require each other so given that
57:03 given that when we when we run a program
57:05 dynamically we're going to have a set
57:07 amount of Rev and every action that we
57:09 take through the course of that program
57:11 is going to decrement the amount of read
57:13 that we have by a certain amount which
57:16 that action is assigned by the weight
57:18 and then the question is if I have a set
57:22 amount of Rev I have three processes
57:25 that are executing in parallel how can I
57:27 guarantee that all operations against
57:32 Rev are valid well there there are two
57:35 courses at least initially that
57:38 identified
57:39 one is to make rather a global value
57:42 which is a bad idea for a number of
57:45 reasons for performance and for for sake
57:47 of accuracy and that the second is is
57:51 actually to to make the cost analysis
57:55 statically by Max Val and then associate
58:00 that max possible cost with each process
58:02 and then use that as the amount that
58:05 we're deducting from dynamically with
58:08 the difference being the refund that we
58:10 get so dynamically we can think of P or
58:15 any any process as as a sequence of of
58:19 actions represented in bytecode and each
58:23 of those are going to affect some state
58:25 of the machine in some way most of those
58:28 will be internal unobservable and
58:32 they're just going to you know whatever
58:33 whatever you can think of a bytecode
58:34 doing and essentially we want to say
58:40 that if any point you reach a revenue
58:43 that is less than or equal to zero we
58:48  want a halt machine insufficient REV
58:50 but of course we also want our you know
58:54 our cost analysis to be consistent with
58:56 the operational semantics structural
58:58 congruences and by similarity of the
59:01 formal model so from from perspective of
59:05 bisimilarity we want to say that if
59:07 two processes can execute on top of of
59:12 course our you know our normal
59:14 requirements for four bisimilarity if
59:16 they can execute with the same amount of
59:18 Rev and both reach a stable halting
59:20 state which implies obviously that Rev
59:24 is not equal to not less than zero then
59:28 they are weakly bisimilar and we
59:31 obviously meet we can't say that they
59:33 are strongly bisimilar because we don't
59:39 know exactly because because they could
59:41 take different unobservable actions that
59:43 ultimately cause the same that have the
59:46 same effect on the environment that's
59:48 unobservable to whatever witness or to
59:50 the environment well
59:53 o h so you folded into your idea that
59:57 they that they do this the IO matching
60:00 right so when you set when you were
60:01 saying on top of the the additional
60:04 requirements of by simulation you so
60:06 that's where you're tacking in that they
60:08 do the IO matching right of course yeah
60:10  all right sorry okay yeah took
60:13 me a minute to parse what you were
60:15 saying there got it sorry about that
60:17 no well then well then the next question
60:20 then was you know how do we synchronize
60:23 essentially two processes how do we
60:25 actually you know transition the system
60:27 and generally the general idea is that
60:31 you know considering we have P part Q
60:33 output part input goes to Q prime or Q
60:37 with bound input that the system will
60:41 transition with the Rev left after
60:45 performing the input action and all of
60:49 course the remaining Rev in P and
60:52 remaining rev up to Q and when it
60:54 transitions it's going to copy the
60:57 remaining amount of Rev into the amount
60:59 of read that use Q witnesses and then
61:02 cue the continuation execute with that
61:04 amount I understand so you're looking at
61:09 the the problem of how to decrement the
61:11 Rev as it's executing yes okay okay yes
61:16 I wasn't quite I was able to follow
61:20 exactly so so yes that's it that's an
61:23 additional piece of the puzzle so in
61:26 addition to estimating the cost up front
61:31 which is a map from the contract to a
61:36 decorated contract so we also want to
61:40 look at the other side on when a
61:43 contract is executing and has a certain
61:46 amount of Rev what's the throttle right
61:50 like how far can it go but without
61:52 without reaching without really exactly
61:55 or a wheel I understand that you will
61:59 have the lower ceiling and then lower
62:02 bound and upper bound
62:03 I'm not sure what you guys are you know
62:06 talking in that sense right
62:08 no no what would Joseph is saying is you
62:12 you need to be able to provide a I'm
62:16 paraphrasing and so and so if I've
62:18 gotten it wrong please just jump in so
62:20 I'm just gonna echo back what I'm
62:21 hearing so eat one and I also want to be
62:27 a little bit more precise we're not
62:28 talking about Rev we're really talking
62:30 about phlogiston sorry legit sorry
62:33 Michael no no no it's totally
62:35 understandable um so a a party an agent
62:41 that wishes to execute a contract on the
62:45 Rho V M um supplies a certain amount of
62:51 Rev in order to get phlogiston the
62:54 question is how much Rev should they
62:57 provide and then once Li and the brendon
63:02 next the next question is once they
63:04 provided that Rev as the contract
63:07 executes and uses up logistic how is the
63:14 pledges in use data and how does that
63:17 relate to the decrement of the rev that
63:20 was supplied sorry um well anytime I
63:24 said rev please pretend I was saying
63:26 phlogiston what I meant was any like
63:28 essentially throughout the execution of
63:29 a process P any action that's internal
63:33 to that is going to decrement the amount
63:36 of phlogiston that we got because you're
63:37 affecting this state of the machine
63:39 essentially and in some way you know
63:41 whether that's whether you're increasing
63:43 the amount of memory that you're using
63:46 you know whether you're executing say an
63:49 instruction which has a cost
63:51 so either data or compute yeah so we so
63:54 we want to get kind of an idea of of how
63:57 much we're going to consume throughout
63:59 the lifetime of the contract so
64:02 statically at compile time we can take
64:04 the maximum like whatever the worst case
64:06  scenario is that takes the most amount
64:08 of phlogiston throughout the entire
64:10 execution and then we're going to
64:11 require that they pay that amount before
64:14 it's executed at amount that max
64:17 is then going to be used as our metric
64:19 dynamically that's going to be used as
64:21 the amount that we start with
64:22 dynamically so in that way we always
64:24 have enough logistic you know in the
64:27 worst possible scenario to finish but if
64:30 they overpay if you if you know say we
64:33 don't run at worst-case scenario then
64:35 we're gonna get a refund on the amount
64:36 of phlogiston that you gave us in red do
64:39 I want to step back you know I'm not
64:41 sure why you are including a term
64:43 dynamic right so if you are already
64:45 setting up a upper bound and lower bound
64:47 so let me step back further so somebody
64:50 at has certain amount of Reb with your
64:53 contract to be exited in the future date
64:55 whatever Millie and between Rev and Flo
64:59 distance right there will be some
65:00 mechanics how they can get certain
65:02 amount of lessons that will be
65:04 applicable to get the computation
65:06 storage and network all three things
65:08 together right sure yeah I'm not sure
65:11 how you dynamically changing because
65:13 before you put your contact into the
65:15 network my I would imagine you'll have a
65:18 fixed rate for these things which may
65:20 change with time but when you are
65:22 signing a contract that amount should
65:24 remain same you know so what what he's
65:29 saying is that as the contract executes
65:32 so let's consider a very simple contract
65:34 right so like the hello world contract
65:36 in the hello world contract the contract
65:40 waits on the channel world one for a
65:44 message now in order to run that
65:47 contract the agent that submitted the
65:50 contract for execution needs to supply
65:54 some Rev when they supply let's say they
65:57 you know just for purposes of discussion
66:00 they supply 10 Rev right and and for
66:05 that Rev they get so much phlogisten we're
66:08 able to you know provide so much
66:11 logistic now if they have provided a
66:15 sufficient amount of Rev for a
66:17 sufficient amount of phlogiston they can
66:19 actually perform the read on the channel
66:22 world one if they have not provided
66:26 sufficient Rev
66:30 then that Reid can't be performed so so
66:34 so imagine that the message is is a one
66:36 terabyte video right and and they've
66:42 only provided this this 10 Rev and so as
66:46 a result they don't have very much
66:48 fledged iStent so they can't actually
66:50 perform the data operation associated
66:53 with the read right and you know and so
66:56 what what should happen Utley why the
66:57 contract and let me just let me just
67:00 finish for this for the purpose of the
67:01 audience that might listen later so what
67:04 should happen is they'll get an out of
67:07 phlogiston error like a theory I'm out
67:11 of gas error
67:12 right and and then and then the contract
67:15 will roll back in the sense that that
67:17 any any data that was read from the
67:20 channel partially it will be as if it
67:23 had never been read and another contract
67:25 potentially could pick up that data and
67:27 consume it for itself um now if they
67:32 sound is bad hmm well it's if you can
67:37 hopefully read information you can leak
67:40 something in there yet no you can the
67:44 problem now it's a it's a lot safer than
67:47 it sounds because the the contract can't
67:51 can't have the read things are partial I
67:55 mean a atomic not partial so if the read
67:59 doesn't happen then the continuation
68:01 doesn't ever get a chance to execute
68:04 okay Greg I just complete the picture
68:09 and then we can then we can jump in with
68:11 with lively debate now suppose that um
68:16 that the the amount of data that was
68:20 read was much smaller than what was
68:23 allotted for in the phlogiston that was
68:27 associated to the contract so the read
68:30 succeeds so the message is read from the
68:33 channel and now you can move on to the
68:36 continuation but at that point the
68:38 continuation should not have the same
68:40 supply of phlogiston it has to have a
68:44 supply of phlogiston that is decremented by
68:47 the action the the amount that's
68:50 associated with the action of reading
68:51 and that's what Joseph is talking about
68:54 so the I seek you know theoretical
68:58 challenge with this whole theory number
69:00 one you are already defining upper
69:03 bounds and lower bounds for you know how
69:05 much it's gonna cost and my submission
69:07 that when you are tossing it then you
69:09 shouldn't get just upper bounds not
69:10 lower bills agreed so now now another
69:15 example you gave one terabyte so my
69:17 expectation would be when you are
69:18 floating a contract or pushing a
69:21 contract into Rho V M you will give them
69:23 the estimate and you charge you know
69:25 upfront and that's one way unless until
69:29 you define a contact which which would
69:31 have dynamic charging capabilities where
69:34 you know VM would charge that contract
69:37 dynamically right I mean there are two
69:38 separate kind of contact we are talking
69:40 about let's um let's kind of make a
69:46 distinction um well I guess first it
69:49 would be really helpful if um and I
69:52 guess I I mean I assumed it but reading
69:56 the etherium documentation on exactly
69:59 you know how their gas pricing works
70:02 would be would be really useful right
70:04 now the their entire approach is dynamic
70:08 it's as the contract is run with every
70:10 action every bytecode that's executed we
70:12 decrement the amount of gas by a certain
70:14 amount so what I'm what I'm saying is
70:17 it's simply that because we don't know
70:20 precisely the amount of phlogiston
70:24 that's going to be consumed at actual
70:26 runtime because there are just things
70:28 that we cannot know we take a Max bound
70:31 and upper bound statically and we charge
70:33 that upfront at runtime we decrement
70:39 from that amount per action that is
70:42 executed on the machine and then the
70:44 remaining amount is refunded or given as
70:47 and partially I think actually yeah the
70:50 remaining amount is is refunded if in
70:52 fact it doesn't require the entire
70:54 amount of phlogiston that was given
70:55 upfront so another way of stating
70:57 this is the compiler figures out a
71:01 deposit that you have to make a safety
71:03 deposit you make the safety deposit you
71:06 run your program and then you get
71:08 whatever part of the deposit back
71:11 that wasn't consumed by the program
71:14 that's correct yes exactly
71:17 does that make sense not me no I mean in
71:22 third Eagle cents yes that's one way but
71:24 I think we have already muddied the
71:27 water with dynamic content right so
71:30 suppose you don't know the size of the
71:34 read operations later on right in that
71:38 case how do you do that
71:39 I mean read that supposing in the beginning
71:42 of the service have two different kind
71:45 of contracts to buy one would be the
71:47 fixed pricing second what is the dynamic
71:49 pricing right no no it's it's not fixing
71:53 both of them together I think this is a
71:55 misunderstanding we're not talking about
71:56 there's no dynamic pricing here what
72:00 would starting the night charge no no
72:04 the dynamism comes from just
72:06 decrementing the rev that's being
72:08 consumed or the phlogiston that's being
72:11 consumed while the contract executes
72:13 that's the only form of dynamism the
72:16 pricing itself the dynamics is the
72:19 pricing is a market thing right the the
72:22 dynamics of decrementing the rep has to
72:25 do with allowing the contract to execute
72:26 as the contract is executing the pricing
72:29 is not being adjusted as the contract is
72:32 executing the only things being adjusted
72:34 is how much phlogiston has been consumed
72:37 in executing each statement oh yeah yeah
72:43 how would the estimates not be a almost
72:46 infinite so if it depends on the size of
72:48 an input which could be infinite I'm
72:51 thinking would the estimates come out as
72:54 so high that it would be impractical yes
72:58 doesn't have it's a good question in
73:01 exam room yeah
73:02 so in general think about it from the
73:04 point of view of the java virtual
73:06 machine right so even though the list is
73:09 infinite
73:10 actually infinite in length the pointer
73:12 to the head of the list is not so so you
73:17 know that the read operation on reading
73:20 a list is bounded initially by getting
73:24 that first pointer and then exploration
73:28 of the remainder of the list corresponds
73:30 to additional read operations so so that
73:35 that's where you can you can you can
73:38 look at reasonable upper bounds that
73:41 make sense I mean I think I mean
73:44 conceptually I understand Greg I think I
73:47 mean my confusion started when you know
73:50 I think one of the statement I heard
73:52 done implications of the flow distance I
73:55 think conceptually I understand how this
73:57 is going to work mean I don't have any
73:59 confusion anywhere so I think it's much
74:03 more implementation detail with how we
74:05 are gonna achieve these things in our
74:08 chain that's where my confusion came
74:10 otherwise I think I'm good thank you
74:12 well we'll imagine okay so imagine that
74:15 your Rev that the amount of Rev that you
74:17 have is contained in a register so it's
74:21 you know easily accessible and very
74:23 quick in very quick to decrement and
74:26 then you know with every action that we
74:28 execute it'd be just like decrementing
74:30 any other value or incrementing the the
74:34 instruction pointer
74:35 yep that's right Marnie well respect
74:38 logistic yeah yeah my question with
74:45 respect to our chain would be you know
74:47 suppose your contract does 10 reads and
74:50 you had spent 10 revs and a completed
74:58 nine of them but the 10th one it
74:59 couldn't complete now you would get it
75:04  out of logician error but those nine
75:08 reads that were already done so you
75:10 don't have to restart the whole contract
75:12 or no well in the case that you in the
75:15 case that that you do run out of
75:17 phlogiston during runtime then the
75:20 machine would recognize halting
75:22 condition
75:23 so it would stop and then would roll
75:24 back all the changes that had been that
75:27 had been performed that's one of the
75:28 benefits that we get for free you know
75:31 by the consensus mechanism is that we
75:33 have a guaranteed past history of states
75:37 so you know pretend like none of this
75:39 ever happened in the case that you run
75:41 out of phlogiston at runtime yeah Jim you
75:45 raised a really good point that that's
75:47 related to long long-running
75:49 transactions long computations and
75:51 checkpoints so the benefit of Rholang is
75:56 that it allows you to organize your
75:57 computation in such a way that if you
76:00 know it's reasonable to commit without
76:05 having to read all ten of them then then
76:08 you can do that you can write code that
76:12 it is aware of that verses code that
76:15 needs all ten of them in order to commit
76:17 so so so the the transactional nature or
76:22 the transactional semantics of the for
76:25 comprehension allows you to set your
76:27 boundaries exactly as you want so that
76:31 you know for example if you if there are
76:34 10 parallel reads from ten parallel
76:37 channels you could write that as a for
76:39 as a join in a for comprehension and and
76:43 then all of those have to go or or or or
76:48 the continuation doesn't happen at all
76:51 alternatively you can you can arrange
76:56 your contract in a different way and
76:58 there there's several different options
76:59 within the language so that you can have
77:02 partial commits rights and and and allow
77:06 for a resumption of a state even if you
77:09 get an out of gas error so that that
77:13 gives you a considerable leeway within
77:16 the language to be aware of the fact
77:19 that there's a correlation between
77:21 resource consumption and transactional
77:24 boundaries so that's that's a that's a
77:26 really good point you raise and one that
77:29 I think is a particular strength for for
77:32 Rholang and Rchain very very good
77:36 okay we're we're way over I know
77:39 Christian I wanted to chat
77:41 I totally I think it's great this is
77:45 great conversation let's continue
77:47 continue to have this conversation I
77:49 need to jump off but I also want to
77:52 mention to the community so no one is
77:53 surprised um I'm getting married on
77:58 September on September 15th the weekend
78:01 of September 15th I'm getting married
78:02 and and where we're going to be away for
78:06 about two weeks from the middle of
78:09 September to the end of September
78:11 Mazeltov thank you thank you thank you
78:16 very much
78:17 awesome I'm very very excited yeah um my
78:22 my partner but the marriage certificate
78:27 on the blockchain uh but but but but
78:31 but you know um I would have out of
78:35 respect and because I'm really looking
78:37 forward to it I'm going to be a away
78:40 from from you know business
78:42 communications and and even though I
78:44 consider many many people here family
78:47 certainly friends but but we've been
78:50 working together for so long it feels
78:51 more like a familial relationship is
78:54 going to be important for me to unplug
78:56 for at least a couple of weeks and then
78:59 get back to things with a fresh bigger
79:04 thank you thank you for all the
79:07 congratulations well so with that with
79:11 that I'm gonna bow out um
